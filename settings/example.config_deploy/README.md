# Example Config Deploy profile
This is an example of profile support Drupal configuration management.

# Using custom profile with CMI
You do just copy all folder `example.config_deploy` and past in your site on location `/web/profiles/custom/`. 
Rename all `example.config_deploy` as you want and edit .install file,
 to change `config_deploy_install` by `YOUR_PROFILE_NAME_install`.
Your Profile is ready to use and re-import an existing configuration.
Enjoy.
